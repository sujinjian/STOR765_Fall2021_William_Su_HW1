title("Dota 2 Average Player Count 2019")
```

Here we are looking at the average player count of the game Dota 2 during 2019. 
2019 is an interesting year when compared to the previous 3 years (listed below).

As you can see, the previous 3 years exhibits a similar pattern while 2019 is more wild.

The most noteworthy is just how stable the average player count is for previous 3 yeaers.
Another is that near the end of summer(Aug, September), there is a big Dota 2 tournament called The International(TI).
Valve(The game developer) does alot of things in the summer to promote it, so there is usually a jump in the player base. Along with other factors like summer break etc. 

However 2019 shows a steady pattern of dropping players leading up to the end of summer.
What's more interesting is that 2020(Last graph of the page) shows a similar trend, but there was no TI in 2020 due to Covid-19. 

```{r}
for (x in c(2018,2017,2016)){
  dota2_data_year = dota2_data[dota2_data$year == x,]

  plot(month_factor, dota2_data_year$avg,
      xlab="Month ", ylab="Average Player Count", ylim=c(50000,800000))
  titles<- paste(c("Dota 2 Average Player Count ", x), collapse = "")
  title(titles)

}
```



```{r}
dota2_data_year = dota2_data[dota2_data$year == 2020,]

plot(month_factor, dota2_data_year$avg,
    xlab="Month ", ylab="Average Player Count", ylim=c(50000,800000))
titles<- paste(c("Dota 2 Average Player Count ", x), collapse = "")
title(titles)
